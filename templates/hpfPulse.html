                    The HPF Pulse project was created to provide victims, heroes, caregivers and volunteers a
                    directory for finding services in all 50 states. Pulse is there to let you know who is out
                    there and willing to help with a form of violence that you may have experienced. Users will
                    have the ability to search for services that fall under the three categories that HPF focuses on -
                    Child Abuse, Domestic Violence or Bullying and then find resources available in every single state.
