                I am a Junior Software Developer, with a passion for learning. I graduated from Indiana
                University East, with a degree in Informatics. I have had experience with a number of programming
                technologies, including Python, JAVA, AngularJS, HTML5, CSS, and javascript. In my spare time I
                enjoy knitting and playing the ukulele.
